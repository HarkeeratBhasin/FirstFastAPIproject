# My First FastAPI Project 🚀

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my very first FastAPI project repository!  

## About Me  
- **Name**: Harkeerat Bhasin  
- **Age at Project Creation**: 17  
- **Location**: India 🇮🇳  
- **Passion**: I'm deeply passionate about coding and aspire to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  

This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of backend development and modern web APIs. I hope to learn, grow, and eventually contribute to impactful projects in the field of AI/ML.

## Project Overview  

This is a simple yet foundational project built using **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

### Features:
- 🚀 Fast and easy-to-use RESTful API.
- 📚 Well-documented with FastAPI's auto-generated Swagger UI.
- 🛠️ Modular and clean codebase to encourage maintainability and scalability.

## Why FastAPI?  
I chose FastAPI for its:
1. High performance, powered by Starlette and Pydantic.
2. Built-in support for data validation and documentation.
3. Beginner-friendly nature and growing popularity in the developer community.
